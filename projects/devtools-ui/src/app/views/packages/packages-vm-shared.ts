/**
 * Shared internals of the Packages vm builder — the canonical (share scope,
 * package) group shape and the ID-keyed store-façade indexes used by the row
 * half (`packages-row-vm.ts`), the detail half (`packages-detail-vm.ts`),
 * and the chunk half (`packages-chunk-vm.ts`). Views import from the
 * `packages-view-model.ts` facade only.
 *
 * Everything here joins the canonical read surface —
 * `model.resolutionProjection`, `model.effectiveConsumerResolutions`, and
 * `model.registryEvidence` — by ID only. Nothing re-derives resolver,
 * action, or copy semantics; the builders group and label precomputed
 * knowledge (T7).
 *
 * The cross-view vocabulary (scope constants, select ids, sentinel
 * display) lives in `shared/view-conventions.ts` since T11, joined by the
 * canonical-façade join helpers (indexes, copy-source attribution, target
 * file display) lifted there with their second consumer (T8 Remotes); the
 * re-exports keep this module's import sites stable.
